Summer 2020 Python Project with Con Edison
Task 3: Perform and compare skill-matching approaches for 2020 labor resource plan
In addition to the maintenance plan, Con Edison also sets an annual resource plan, which is the labor
staffing strategy necessary to execute the annual maintenance plan. This task will explore some of the
most common matching algorithms and their suitability to the resource plan, in order to match the skill
sets and characteristics of available maintenance staff members to the needs of each area. A preliminary
resource plan using a matching algorithm based on skill sets will be delivered, after which additional
matching algorithms will be tested and compared for future resource planning. Future updates will also
consider other worker characteristics, including geographic preferences and colleague preferences.
